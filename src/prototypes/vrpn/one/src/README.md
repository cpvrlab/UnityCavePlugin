=========

Simple VRPN wrapper for unity

You can build the dll from scratch or use the download in the releases.
The dll must be placed in the Assets/Plugins folder to use.  Place VRPN.cs (found in the scriptForUnity folder in the source) in whatever assets folder you wish.  This will allow you to use the static VRPN class.

-> public static double vrpnAnalog(string address, int channel)
This gets an analog value from the vrpn address and the channel.  When first called with a new address, the vrpn connection will be created.  An address's values will be updated at most once per frame.

-> public static bool vrpnButton(string address, int channel)
This gets a boolean value from the vrpn address and the channel.  When first called with a new address, the vrpn connection will be created.  An address's values will be updated at most once per frame.

-> public static Vector3 vrpnTrackerPos(string address, int channel)
This gets position component of a tracker at the vrpn address and the channel.  When first called with a new address, the vrpn connection will be created.  An address's values will be updated at most once per frame.

-> public static Quaternion vrpnTrackerQuat(string address, int channel)
This gets rotation component of a tracker at the vrpn address and the channel.  When first called with a new address, the vrpn connection will be created.  An address's values will be updated at most once per frame.
